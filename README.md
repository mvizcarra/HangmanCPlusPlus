# HangmanCPlusPlus-
Hello, this is a traditional Hangman game reconstructed into C++. This is a 2 player game. Players will enter their name. Player 1 will enter a word. Player 2 will then guess. Players get 6 mistakes. If Player 2 gets the word or makes 6 mistakes then the score will be updated and displayed. Then turns will switch. Player 2 will enter a word and Player 1 will guess. This will conclude one round. Players can then choose to continue or exit. When players exit, the final score will be displayed and the winner will be displayed.
